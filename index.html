                The purpose of a pattern library is to showcase and group together the components used in a website like for instance a portfolio and display them with appropriate documentation. These components have been browser tested and checked to in order to make sure that the each and every component works well in each browser, they have also been validated through W3Schools, ensuring the code quality is as high as possible. </p>

                <p>
                The documentation provided for each component is thorough so that its usage and description so that it is known to all developers and designers on the project, each components code can be found and is validated to use straight away in the current project or another project.  
                </p>
